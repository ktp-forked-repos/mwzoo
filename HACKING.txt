HACKING GUIDE

HOW TO ADD A NEW ANALYSIS TASK (analysis/tasks.py)
#1) derive a new class from AnalysisTask (or ConfigurableAnalysisTask)
#2) if you want it to have configuration options, derive from ConfigurableAnalysisTask and create a etc/analysis/YOUR_CLASS_NAME.ini file
#2a) note that there is an option for loading JSON files as the configuration as well, need to make this better supported
#3) override the analyze method which receives a reference to the mwzoo.Sample object and returns a dict() that contains the results of the analysis in any format you want
#3a) the results of the analysis are stored in { 'analysis' [ { 'details' : YOUR_DICT_HERE } ] }
#4) if you need to store binary data somewhere, see the YaraAnalysis task as an example
#5) if your analysis depends on the execution of another analysis module, add a depends_on attribute to your class with a list of all the modules it depends on

example:

        # file type analysis must be done
        self.depends_on = [ FileTypeAnalysis ]
