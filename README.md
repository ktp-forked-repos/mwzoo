Malware Zoo

Dependencies (required Ubuntu software packages)
 - python-twisted
 - python-pefile

Ideas:
 - Use celery to distribute tasks
 - Write simple interface definition for tasks
 - Store analysis data in folders
 - Sync data to be used for relational purposes in MySQL or SQLITE3
 - Make interfacing for CRITs
 - Don't necessarily bother w/ cuckoo... maybe just write our own lightweight automated-sandbox (again)...
 - Cuckoo is annoying and finicky and wants too much to become a "complete, do all things, solution"
